# cs211grades
This is a calculator to find out your weighted grade in CS 211 at UIC

Note: this is only for cs 211 at UIC

This will be the worst JavaScript you've ever seen. Trust me.

A couple notes:

1. I didn't test this on internet explore because you shouldn't be using internet explore.

2. If you got a 35/40 on a code review, all you enter is a 35. And so on and so forth for your other grades.

3. If you accidentally press a button too many times, too bad you're going to have to start over. Someone should fix this.

4. I know this looks bad. I don't care. If you want to submit a pull request and make things better, be my guest.

5. If you have any questions please feel free to ask
